Alright, so here goes. A second post dedicated to my new Macbook Air and what I've got set up on it. I decided to start fresh with just a few of my favorite apps! Here's the list of what I've got going on thus far.

#### First, the apps I use for coding:
* [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [Github](http://www.github.com)
* [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/)

#### These are the apps that I use for keepin in touch with folks:
* [Propane](http://propaneapp.com/)
* [Skype](http://www.skype.com)
* [Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id409789998)

#### This group is all about keeping me organized and albe to see what I'm working on:
* [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/)
* [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)
* [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)
* [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/)
* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com)

And as always, I'm 100% behind [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/).

I've got some more stuff under the hood thanks to [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), but that's it as far as basic apps. I hope you like what you saw, and give the apps and their devs some <3.
